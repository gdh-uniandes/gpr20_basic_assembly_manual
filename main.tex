\section{Introduction}
This document presents the instructions to assembly the basic structure of the GPR-20 robot. The basic assembly assumes that all the parts and elements have been either manufactured or acquired. Assembly of the structure requires tools such as a saw, screwdrivers and pliers. A soldering iron or a heating gun is also required. Finally, the person that will build the robot must meet the appropriate safety requirements. Usage of safety gloves and goggles is strongly recommended. 

This document aims to allow an user to assembly the five basic groups of the GPR-20 robot. The five basic groups are intended to be transported into the survey location where the field setup can be executed. Basic groups are easier and more safe to transport in comparison to the fully assembled robot. The five basic groups that will be assembled are: ground support, Y-Axis, X-Axis, VNA holder and the electronics box. Table \ref{tab:basic_groups} introduces each of the basic groups and its purpose.

\section{Ground Support Assembly}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Focus on the \textit{component 0} part which is shown on figure \ref{fig:gs_step_1}. You will find a hole through the part and a slot to accommodate a M7 screw nut. Put the M7 screw nut in the slot and then screw in a M7 screw from the bottom of the part. This assembly will be used later.

    \end{figure}
    
    \item Focus on the \textit{component 1} part which is shown on figure \ref{fig:gs_step_2}. \textit{Component 1} has four holes that are intended to be used for M3 ($\times 4$) and M2 ($\times 4$) brass inserts. The holes for the M2 inserts are located in the inside of the part, at its bottom. The holes for the M3 inserts are located in the top of the part. Heat the brass inserts using either a heat gun or a soldering iron and place them into its corresponding holes. Allow the inserts to cool down before proceeding with the assembly.
